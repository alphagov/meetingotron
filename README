(A work in progress)

A small web app for keeping meetings short and forcing you to take notes, inspired by: http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/sep2006/sb20060927_259688.htm

and from watching how the Open Knowledge Foundation use Etherpad for collaboratively minuting meetings

How it works:

- Asks you for a title, purpose and length of upfront
- Starts a countdown timer
- Displays a split screen half countdown / half etherpad for taking notes
- When the timer hits zero the screen flashes (in the future it might also force you to stop typing by threatening to delete your notes)
- Notes and meeting details are saved for future use

Todo:

- management task for deleting meetings with no notes from the database
- ability to search meetings
- import meeting text into database from etherpad for search indexing
- add an visual/audio trigger for when certain % of meeting time remaining
